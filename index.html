        <h1> Methodology </h1>
        <div class='notes'>
          Over the course of a year, from 1/20/15 to 1/20/16, every instance of defecation was recorded in a spreadsheet. Defecation, I defined as, a sit, a loaf, a wipe, and a flush. Courtusy flushes, half an hour slugfests, and multiple wipe and poo sessions
          did not increase the tally more than once. I recorded four statistics regarding each poop, date, time, location, and consistancy. Consistancy was measured via eyeball, in reference to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale'>Bristol School Scale </a>.
          Raw data can be found <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13KKdGDYjxb085kSAB_LGJ7zIiQdtTBZD37K4uf4JH9g/edit?usp=sharing'> here</a>. Without further ado, lets get into this mess.

        1a - Perdictably, my most frequent poop locations occured at work, with a secondary location of my home. Assuming each poop averaged about 5 minutes, at NYS minimum wage (8.75), pooping on the company dime will have made around $185.20 this year. To see
        the top 5 non-home and non-work locations, please click on the "Other" slice of the pie graph.
        <br />
        <br /> 1b - Shows the number of n-poop days I had this year. With an average of 1.4, it's not suprising that most frequently 1 poop days occured, followed by 2 poop days. Strangely enough I did go through multiple days, 24 to be exact, days with 0 poops.
        The smallest slice of our graph here, are days I remember most fondly, 4 poop days, these miasma filled days were usually caused by a combination of binge drinking, sickness, or an unrepenting love for curry.

        2a - I averaged 42 poops per month, with a high of 53 (January) and a low of 35 (August). The inconsistancies, taking into account the differences of days in a month, I found expected. The average consistancy also varied wildly, with a high of 4.4 (October
        was a sloppy month), and a low of 3.5 in May. The only trend that seemed to hold true was a higher volume of poops during colder months. I attribute this to more leafy greens and fresh fruit consumed during summer, and more hearty meals and more
        indoor time during the winter.

        2b - Here we really start to see a trend forming, a skyrocket in the looseness of my stool on Sunday correlates to my habit of having more than a few drinks on Saturday nights. Poops are fairly consistant during the week, most likely due to perdictable
        coffee consumption. We also notice a slight droop during Friday and the weekend, when I generally have better things to do than poop!

          3a - Perdictably my most frequent poops came during daylight hours, with the hour of 10-11 dominating my fecal frequency with 93 poops. We've seperated the weekday and weekend poops to highlight the difference stability makes, specifically routine coffee
          drinking at around 10o'clock. More suprising was the uptick of poops after 19:00, especially after hitting the near low of six 18:00 poops, of which, four came on the weekend. One could infer that this was my cooking and eating time, after returning
          home from work.
