        <div class='notes'>
          Over the course of a year, from 1/20/15 to 1/20/16, every instance of defecation was recorded in a spreadsheet.  Defecation, I defined as, a sit, a loaf, a wipe, and a flush.  Courtusy flushes, half an hour slugfests, and multiple wipe and poo sessions did not increase the tally more than once.
          I recorded four statistics regarding each poop, date, time, location, and consistancy.  Consistancy was measured via eyeball, in reference to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale'>Bristol School Scale </a>.  Raw data can be found <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13KKdGDYjxb085kSAB_LGJ7zIiQdtTBZD37K4uf4JH9g/edit?usp=sharing'> here</a>.
          Without further ado, lets get into this mess.

        1a - Perdictably, my most frequent poop locations occured at work, with a secondary location of my home.
        Assuming each poop averaged about 5 minutes, at NYS minimum wage (8.75), pooping on the company dime will have made around $185.20 this year.

        1b -  Shows the number of n-poop days I had this year.  With an average of 1.4, it's not suprising that most frequently 1 poop days occured, followed by 2 poop days.  Strangely enough I did go through multiple days, 24 to be exact, days with 0 poops.
        The smallest slice of our graph here, are days I remember most fondly, 4 poop days, these miasma filled days were usually caused by a combination of binge drinking, sickness, or an unrepenting love for curry.
